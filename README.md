FD Generator
============

A simple Python console utility to generate functional dependencies and projections for sets of them. Done to assist work for CSC343 Fall 2014.

Can do the following:
 * Load multiple sets of FDs
 * Generate the closure of a subset of attributes within a set of FDs
 * Generate all closures of a list of attributes within a set of FDs
 * Infer the FDs of a closure within a set of FDs and an attribute subset
 * Get the projection of a set of FDs onto an attribute subset
 * Output the results to a file or to the commandline

Anyone is free to use it for any purpose and is free to improve it.
